Facebook loves React.JS because it decreases page load time through both client- and server-side rendering. This, in turn, helps create a smoother experience for users.

In contrast to Angular.JS, React.JS also puts much more focus on the user interface. The interface is highly responsive and usually has a decreased load time and fewer interruptions. Both are a huge help for those who can’t stand to be slowed down by their machines.
